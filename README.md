# Terraform - Infrastructure Provisioning Tool

**Terraform** is an open source infrastructure as a code tool to automatically build your infrastructure. 

Terraform loads all files ending in .tf or .tf.json in the working directory. List of Terraform providers: https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers

First of all, follow this URL to install Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

Login to GCP on your server:

gcloud auth application-default login --no-launch-browser

Credentials will be saved to the following file:

/root/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json

**Important Terraform Commands:**

terraform init    ==========>   Initializes your working directory for terraform. Your terraform files must be there.

terraform plan    ==========>   It generates an overview of how terraform will execute the plan. It does not actually build the infrastructure, simply shows a layout.

terraform fmt    ==========>   Properly formats the terraform configuration file.

terraform init --reconfigure  [If you did some changes in main.tf or added any additional file, and you want to reflect those changes]

==================================================

**terraform.tfstate** file stores the current state of your infrastructure components, on your local machine.

terraform init -upgrade    ==========>   When we upgrade the version of Terraform provider. The error looks similar to the following:

Could not retrieve the list of available versions for provider hashicorp/google: locked provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google 3.90.1 does not match configured version constraint ~> 4.41.0;
â”‚ must use terraform init -upgrade to allow selection of new versions

I have updated the current version 3.90.1 to the latest available 4.41.0.
